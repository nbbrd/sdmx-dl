## What is sdmx-dl?

[SDMX](https://sdmx.org/?page_id=3425) is a standard for exchanging statistical data and [sdmx-dl](https://github.com/nbbrd/sdmx-dl) is a tool to download that data.

This project has two parts:
- [a Java library](api) that can be incorporated into other projects
- [a command-line tool](cli) that allows to easily browse and download data

## Why sdmx-dl?

SDMX is a standard but has the following issues:
- Slightly different interpretation from each provider
- Incomplete; doesn't' cover some technical details
- No native support in mainstream applications (Excel, RStudio, â€¦)

## Goals & features

- Provides easy and reliable **data retrieval**
- Allows **data discovery** and **automation**
- Corrects deviations from the standard
- Takes care of technical difficulties
- Is designed to be integrated into other applications
